== Description ==

A responsive and accessible theme for Ministry of Justice (MoJ).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this on any MoJ website? =
Yes, the only restriction being that you need to have WordPress running first :)

= Can I use it on a non MoJ website =
Yes, it is open source code and can be used anywhere. However, you may not use the MoJ logo or pass your site off as an MoJ organisation if you are not.

= Do you offer support? =
Yes, either through the themes support pages on WordPress, or via our GitHub project https://github.com/ministryofjustice/wp-hale

= Can I get involved? =
Yes - please do! Whether you work in the MoJ or would just like to contribute, we are happy to involve the wider
community in this work and will consider any pull requests or code snippets you are happy to contribute.

= How do I customise my 404 page? =
All content on the 404 error page is widgetised. Navigate to admin > appearance > widgets and add your chosen widgets and content to the `404 page` widget.

= How does the menu system work? =
The top level navigation has NO dropdowns or expander functionality. This is by design. This means your header menu is
one level only.

 = What is the subpages widget =
 The subpages widget shows pages  in the current navigation tree. When you add the widget, you can configure how this
 behaves and whether the top level page is linked etc.
